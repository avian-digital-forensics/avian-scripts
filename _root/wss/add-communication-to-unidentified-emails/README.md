# Add communication to unidentified emails
Uses the output of the in-app script '[FixUnidentifiedEmails](https://github.com/avian-digital-forensics/avian-scripts/tree/master/avian-inapp-scripts/unidentified-emails/fix-unidentified-emails.nuixscript)' to add communication information to items representing emails that haven't been identified by Nuix.
If that script hasn't been run on the items, this WSS will fail.
